 # Who is @Carmelitu?
## About Me 👨‍🦱
- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Seijo. I work as a fullstack developer at Lumile Argentina.
- 🐩 Why Carmelo? Well, he is my dog :)
- 🌊 I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A beatiful city to be sure.
- 👀 I am interested in the dark side or better known as the backend. I really like to understand the logic of things and that's why I love puzzles.
- 🪙 Also, I am an enthusiast of the blockchain world. I want to contribute my grain of sand to web3.
- 💎 In 2021, I discovered that programming is what I want to do and what I want to live for. I don't think there are words to describe how much I like it, it is a feeling that you know it instantly.
