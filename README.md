 # Who is @Carmelitu?
## About Me 👨‍🦱
- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carmelitu better known as Lucas Seijo.
- 🐩 Why Carmelo? Well, he is my dog :)
- 🌊 I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A beatiful city to be sure.
- 👀 I am interested in learning how to be a backend developer. I really like to understand the logic of things and that's why I love puzzles.
- 💎 In 2021, I discovered that programming is what I want to do and what I want to live for. I don't think there are words to describe how much I like it, it is a feeling that you know it instantly.

## Where I study 📖
- 👩‍🎓 I started studying Programming at the UTN - Mar del Plata in 2021. I finished the first semester with all the subjects passed and an average of 9.6/10.

- 🤓 In my spare time, I study some new technology or seek to reinforce something I already know by taking courses on Udemy. I am also very interested in participating in trainings!



     *It seems that I enjoy studying this, right?*
     

# Skills 🔑

## JavaScript 🌐

I am currently learning JavaScript from a very comprehensive course on Udemy. Particularly this course. In my repository you can see the things I have been doing with this language.

## C 👨‍💻

C is the first language I knew. I'm still learning it in college and I really like it because of its complexity. In my repository you will find the project with which I finished the semester in the subject of Programming with two colleagues.

## Git 🖇️

I learned how to use Git in a Udemy course and thanks to that I know this platform. I put it to constant use for tomorrow when I get to work as a developer and have to know the application well.

## SCRUM ⌚

I also learned about this agile methodology through Udemy. I have not been able to put it into practice yet, I hope to be able to apply it soon. I find it very interesting and functional for the IT world.
