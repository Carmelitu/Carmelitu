 # Who is @Carmelitu?
- 👋 Hi, I’m Lucas Seijo. I work as Fullstack Blockchain Developer! I'm so happy about that.
- 🐩 Why Carmelitu? Well, Carmelo is my dog :)
- 🌊 I live in Mar del Plata, Argentina. A beatiful city to be sure.
- 💎 In 2021, I discovered that programming is what I want to do and what I want to live for. I don't think there are words to describe how much I like it, it is a feeling that you know it instantly.
- 🪙 Also, I am an enthusiast of the blockchain world. I want to contribute my grain of sand to web3.
- 🤓 In my spare time, I study some new technology or seek to reinforce something I already know. I'm really active!
